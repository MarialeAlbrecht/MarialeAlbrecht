## 🌱 What drives me

I thrive in environments where creativity and logic complement each other. My process often begins with a playful, exploratory mindset—generating ideas, asking questions, and collaborating closely with others. From there, I apply structured analysis to validate discoveries and bring clarity.

Once the ideas are flowing, that’s when I bring in the more logical side—analyzing, testing, and giving shape to what we discovered. It’s a balance that keeps the work joyful while still making sure it all adds up in the end.
